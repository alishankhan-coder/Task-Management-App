## What is this?

TaskFlow is a task manager that doesn't just work - it looks amazing while doing it. I built this with React to create something that's both functional and visually appealing. It has a futuristic design with smooth animations that make managing tasks actually enjoyable.

## What can you do with it?

**Basic stuff:**

- Add new tasks quickly
- Mark tasks as complete
- Edit tasks when plans change
- Delete tasks you no longer need

**Cool features:**

- Set priority levels (High, Medium, Low)
- Organize by categories (Work, Personal, Study, Health, Other)
- Filter tasks (All, Pending, Completed)
- Sort by date, priority, or category
- See live stats of your progress
- Clean up completed tasks with one click

**Nice touches:**

- Everything saves automatically in your browser
- Works great on phones, tablets, and computers
- Keyboard shortcuts for power users
- Smooth animations and visual feedback
- Beautiful dark theme with neon accents

## How to run it

**You'll need:**

- Node.js installed on your computer
- Basic familiarity with the terminal

**Steps:**

1. Download or clone this project
2. Open terminal in the project folder
3. Run `npm install` to get dependencies
4. Run `npm start` to launch the app
5. Open your browser to `http://localhost:3000`

## How it's built

**Tech used:**

- React for the interface
- CSS3 for styling and animations
- Font Awesome for icons
- Local Storage for saving data

**Project structure:**

```
src/
├── components/           # All the React components
│   ├── Header.js        # Top bar with stats
│   ├── TaskInput.js     # Add new tasks
│   ├── TasksList.js     # Display all tasks
│   ├── TaskItem.js      # Individual task
│   ├── TaskModal.js     # Edit task popup
│   └── Footer.js        # Bottom section
├── App.js               # Main app logic
├── App.css              # All the styles
└── index.js             # Entry point
```

## Shortcuts you can use

- `Ctrl + N` (or `Cmd + N` on Mac): Jump to add new task
- `Enter`: Save when adding/editing tasks
- `Escape`: Close any open modals

## Design choices

I went with a dark, futuristic theme because:

- It's easier on the eyes
- The neon colors pop nicely
- It feels modern and sleek
- Great for focus during work

The animations are subtle but meaningful - they give feedback without being distracting.
